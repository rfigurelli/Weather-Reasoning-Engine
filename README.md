## Executive Summary

The Weather Reasoning Engine is an innovative framework that redefines how meteorological forecasts are interpreted, trusted, and operationalized. Traditional weather models output probabilities—like a 40% chance of rain—but fail to communicate the reliability or internal confidence of those estimates. This limitation can lead to misinformed decisions, especially in sectors that depend on precise timing and risk evaluation.

This system introduces a "meta-probability" layer: a mechanism to assess the likelihood that the forecast probability itself is correct. Drawing on physical indicators such as atmospheric inertia, synoptic-scale flow stability, and cloud motion vectors, the Weather Reasoning Engine analyzes the dynamic context behind a forecast. It then adjusts the perceived trust level accordingly.

In addition to physical heuristics, the framework leverages recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and symbolic reasoning to structure contextual evaluations. Inspired by state-of-the-art reasoning research in AI, the Weather Reasoning Engine treats each forecast as an inference chain rather than a single numerical output. By using pretrained language models to encode, evaluate, and justify probabilistic assessments based on atmospheric conditions, the system mimics cognitive decision-making seen in LLMs—where reasoning steps and confidence levels co-evolve \[14]\[15].

This meta-reasoning layer—powered by both meteorological indicators and machine reasoning engines—can be integrated into existing systems to improve communication, decision-making, and resource allocation across domains such as agriculture, aviation, and urban planning. The Weather Reasoning Engine is not merely a forecasting enhancement—it is a cognitive upgrade to how probabilistic weather information is evaluated and trusted.
